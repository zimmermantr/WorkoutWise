WorkoutWise

CRUD: Users will be able to CREATE new workouts by selecting exercises, add it to their workout, set the number of sets, reps, duration, and rest periods. Workouts will be saved for future tracking. Users will be able to view (READ) existing workouts with details of each exercise to track progress. Users can also see descriptions of exercises in order to properly perform the exercise. Users will be able to edit (UPDATE) existing workouts, adding or removing exercises, changing sets, reps, or rest. Users will be able to DELETE entire workouts or specific exercises.

Authentication: Users will be able to create accounts, sign in and out, allowing them to view their workout history and data.

APIs: I will use the Exercises API (https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises) to help users pick specific exercises and them to their workout.

Pitch: Youâ€™re tired after a long day of work and you get to the gym with no mental energy to plan out a workout. Well, {future name inserted here} gives you a list of exercises based on user input such as muscle group, experience level, or even the type of exercise desired. You can then throw these exercises into a workout list and fill it with the awesome details from your workout! Never wander around the gym aimlessly again and track your progress towards a healthier you!
